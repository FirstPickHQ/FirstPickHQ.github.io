              <p>
                Most companies are now tech-driven. With new technologies
                emerging constantly, businesses need to adapt and adopt quickly
                to stay ahead.

                <br /><br />Responsibility for this falls to the CTO (Chief
                Technology Officer). If you are looking for a CTO to manage the
                tech side of your business, you need to understand the role a
                CTO plays and what responsibilities they hold.

                <br /><br />Below, we define the role a CTO plays within a tech
                company and share some further resources from leading figures in
                the tech sector.

                There is no set answer here. Responsibilities vary depending on
                the stage of the company and the sector they’re in, which we’ll
                break out. Some companies will use alternative titles for this
                role (e.g. Head of Engineering). To demonstrate these points,
                here are the mission statements for the CTO roles at 5 prominent
                tech unicorns.

                As the above demonstrates, CTOs at some of the most successful
                tech companies have mostly management related responsibilities.
                However, this isn’t the case for early-stage startups where
                there may only be a few employees and the CTO is often one of
                the founders. This brings us onto the two main types of CTOs.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-3">CTOs - the major types</h2>
              <p>
                The simplest way to classify CTOs is by their key focus within
                an organisation - is it technical leadership or operational
                management?

              <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Technical Leadership</h2>
              <p>
                Typically found in early-stage startups, these CTOs are skilled
                and active engineers with expertise in coding, software
                architecture, cloud infrastructure configuration etc. They’ll do
                a lot of the programming themselves and review the code written
                by other engineers on the team.
              </p>

              <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Operational Management</h2>
              <p>
                At larger or later stage businesses, the CTO is primarily an
                operational manager who’s responsible for running the
                engineering team. They’ll still have a deep understanding of
                programming, but are unlikely to be coding day-to-day anymore.
                Instead, they’ll be shaping the company’s technology strategy
                while managing the engineering efforts.

                <br /><br />As a tech startup grows, the focus of the CTO
                typically switches from technical leadership to operational
                management.

                The CTO role’s evolution within tech startups
              </h2>
              <p>
                The key mission of a CTO is to ensure the company’s tech fully
                serves the business’ strategy. Let’s review the stages that a
                typical startup goes through to better understand how the role
                of CTO changes.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Stage 1 - Business Idea</h2>
              <p>
                At this stage, the CTO validates that the idea is technically
                feasible and will suggest technical solutions to build the
                required software.
              </p>

              <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Stage 2 - Early stage</h2>
              <p>
                Having usually raised some investment, the startup team begins
                to build the product. It’s quite common for the CTO to be the
                only developer on the team at this point, so they’re responsible
                for building the MVP in the shortest possible time.

                <br /><br />This will include choosing the tech stack, designing
                the architecture, setting up scalable infrastructure, and
                software testing. They’ll require excellent programming skills
                and preferably relevant experience as they’ll do a lot of coding
                in the early stages.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Stage 3 - Product-market fit</h2>
              <p>
                As the company starts to gain traction, its focus shifts to
                iterating on its product and improving functionality to make it
                easier to use for a growing customer base. To speed up this
                process, startups will typically hire more developers.

                <br /><br />This alters the CTO’s responsibilities, as
                management comes to the fore. The CTO needs to manage the
                feature development pipeline so the engineers can work
                productively while ensuring the security and reliability of the
                product.

                <br /><br />The CTO also needs to manage the growth of the
                development team, supervising hiring and setting the engineering
                culture within the company. They must ensure that engineers
                follow uniform standards to achieve a high level of
                productivity.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Stage 4 - Growth</h2>
              <p>
                At this point, the tech startup has achieved success and is
                growing into a large business with a sizeable engineering team.
                The CTO leads a large group of developers with an established
                programming culture and workflow. Their responsibility has now
                shifted to management, with new features likely requiring
                oversight of several engineering teams.

                <br /><br />The CTO must also develop the software roadmap,
                keeping track of emerging technology trends and deciding which
                to implement to continue driving the company forwards. In order
                to maintain the startup’s competitive advantage, the CTO must
                have a strong understanding of business processes and
                competitors.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-3">The skills a tech startup CTO needs</h2>
              <p>
                It’s clear that a CTO needs to have expertise in both software
                development and management. Let’s drill down into the skills a
                startup CTO needs. This is rather a long list, so we’ve broken
                it down by the roles a CTO plays.

              <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Senior Executive</h2>
              <p>
                At large companies, CTOs are senior managers who don’t do any
                coding themselves and have predominantly management
                responsibilities. They should be able to:
              </p>
              <div class="content">
                <ul>
                  <li>Engage in company strategy planning</li>
                  <li>Participate in company management</li>
                  <li>
                    Track and analyse competitors, particularly any new tech
                    they might be using
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Present ways in which tech can help the company move forward
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Oversee external workforces (outsourced teams, contractors,
                    remote workers)
                  </li>
                  <li>Track emerging technology trends</li>
                  <li>
                    Evaluate and monitor the company’s technical efficiency
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Control engineering and IT budgets and optimise expenditure
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  At this level, the CTO can’t rely on technical
                  knowledge/ability. They must have a strong knowledge of how
                  the business works and its key drivers.

              <p>
                The CTO does not have to perform each of these personally - that
                will depend on the size of the company the number of engineers
                on the team who these can be delegated to. However, software
                architecture skills are vital for a startup CTO.

                As well as being the development team lead, the CTO also needs
                to be a competent DevOps engineer. A successful tech startup
                needs an efficient deployment pipeline to ensure they can make
                updates safely and regularly.

                <br /><br />The CTO has to set the DevOps culture within their
                business, so should be able to:

              <p>
                In the early stages of a startup’s life, the CTO may have to act
                as the System Admin and manage the company’s IT infrastructure.
                Therefore they should be able to:

                <ul>

                <p>
                  Obviously as an organisation grows, these tasks will be handed
                  over to IT staff.

              <p>
                The CTO is crucial to the success of a tech company. However,
                hiring a professional CTO can be difficult due to the range of
                the required skill set and their evolving responsibilities as a
                startup grows. If you’d like to discuss our CTO executive search
